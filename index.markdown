## What I Do

Primarily, I'm a cycle mechanic and love anything and everything bikes. I've been working in the industry for two years and as a fast learner have gained a wealth of experience and mechanical knowledge. I love building wheels and deep-diving into the engineering and maths of what I'm doing, and learning about material properties.

I love teaching, and hope to spend more of my time sharing everything I have learned and helping other people enter the cycling industry.

When I'm not fixing bikes, I'm probably riding bikes. I love going on long rides on a Sunday through the Scottish moorelands around Glasgow and occasionally venture out further into the Highlands and Trossachs. I'm just getting into bikepacking too, and plan to spend as much of my time off this summer cycling and camping as I can.

I occasionally dabble in the weird and wonderful world of Modular Synthesis, with a long-held fascination in Electronic Engineering. I have more hobby-electronics projects than I can currently keep up with.
I also enjoy the odd bit of coding here and there, and try to make or do something regularly enough to maintain my skills. I also find my programming knowledge useful in my day-to-day work to automate the little things. You can have a look at [my github profile](https://github.com/emilcarr) to see what I've done. 

I like taking pictures of my bike rides, of my friends, and of interesting architecture. Usually shooting on 35mm film, you can find some of the pictures I've taken on this site.

## Where I Work

I work part-time as a Project Worker for [Bikes for Refugees Scotland](https://bikesforrefugees.scot). This is my main living and takes up the bulk of my time. You can read more about Bikes for Refugees and find my work contact details at [bikesforrefugees.scot](https://bikesforrefugees.scot/)

I'm a founding director of [Dynamo Glasgow CIC](https://dynamocic.org). We're a new, feminist, queer-led cycling and maintenance project in Glasgow. You can read more about us at [dynamocic.org](https://dynamocic.org). Currently, I'm taking a step back from much fo this work while my colleagues do a fine job.
