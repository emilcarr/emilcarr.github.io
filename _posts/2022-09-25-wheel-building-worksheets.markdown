These worksheets through a series of diagrams will take your student through measuring their hub, calculating the spoke length with basic trigonometry, and show how the force vectors result in unequal tension on a dished wheel. Perfect for a short wheelbuilding course or as part of a wider general course, or even for use in the workshop.
