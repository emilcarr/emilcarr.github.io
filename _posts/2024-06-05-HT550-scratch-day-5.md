I made the right choice scratching.

I began Day 5 from the shelter in North Kessock, only a short stint over the bridge into Inverness.

Getting an early start so as to not upset the locals, I cross over for 7 in the morning and make my way to the train station. First, a coffee, then a razor from WH Smiths and a shower.

What an amazing shower at Inverness train station! The attendant even gives me a fresh towel, and the dispenser is freshly loaded with shower gel.

Feeling fresh for the first time in days, next I make my way to Boots as soon as it opens and buy some dressings for my knees.

Breakfast at Velocity Cafe - a spot I always visit whenever I'm in Inverness - and some route planning, with some advice from the next table over, I decide to cycle to Fort William and do some dotwatching slong the way.

Within 10 minutes I'm out of the city and onto the great glen way - what a luxury
