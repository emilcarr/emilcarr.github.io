## What I Do

I’m a student of Product Design Engineering and passionate about good design. I enjoy employing traditional techniques to combat modern problems, while keeping artisan skills alive.

When I'm not studying, making, or fixing bikes, I'm probably riding bikes. I love going on long rides on a Sunday  around Glasgow and occasionally venture out into the Highlands and Trossachs. I rode my [my first ultra event in 2023](/poosts/2023/10/13/lesperit-de-girona.html), followed by the Highland Trail 550 in 2024, and continue to ride Audaxes, with a few yearly fixtures on my calendar.

I like taking pictures of my bike rides, of my friends, and of interesting architecture. Usually shooting on 35mm film, you can find some of the pictures I've taken on this site.

## Where I Work

I’m currently a full-time student, studying Product Design Engineering at the Glasgow School of Art and the University of Glasgow.

I previously worked part-time as a Project Worker for [Bikes for Refugees Scotland](https://bikesforrefugees.scot). I have also been involved in a number of non-profit cycling organisations.
